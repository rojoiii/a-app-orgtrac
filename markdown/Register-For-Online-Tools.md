### GitHub

GitHub is a product used primarily for managing project with source code and maintaining a file history for these projects using a version control system (VCS) called git.

For the purposes of OrgTrac and your organization we make use of GitHub for hosting this wiki and for storing the project files.

Once that is done simply sign into the Google Account and go [here](https://play.google.com/apps/publish/signup/) and follow the directions to create a developer account.

### Contentful

Contentful is a content management system (CMS) and is headless meaning that it can be used to define, create, and update any type of content you wish. Since Contentful allows you to freely define your data and has all the features OrgTrac and your organization will need available in a free tier we make heavy use of it in this project. All the data displayed in the OrgTrac application, and eventually your organization's application, is created and stored in Contentful
