## Your Tools

The tools needed to use OrgTrac and Ultimately allow you to create an application for your own organization are:
* GitHub Desktop
* Android Studio


### GitHub Desktop
***
GitHub Desktop is an application that allows you to use GitHub through a user friendly interface without having to install additional tools or use terminal/command-line arguments to download the OrgTrac project from GitHub. If you are familiar with git via the terminal/command-line, or another tool such as SourceTree, feel free to skip installing GitHub Desktop and use the tools you are familiar with.

In order to install GitHub Desktop simply go [here](https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/getting-started-with-github-desktop/installing-github-desktop/) and follow the directions to install the application.

If you are using MacOS I advise you to drag the _GitHub Desktop_ application file you unzipped into your Applications folder and launch it from there. We will walk through setting up the application later in the Wiki so you do not need to open the application at this time.

### Android Studio
***
Android Studio is the de-facto Integrated Developer Environment (IDE) used for developing Android Applications. Within it you'll be able to edit files, generate signature certificates, run the application on an emulator, and build the binary for distribution on the Google Play Store. Since it is an IDE it has many more uses but these are the ones most important to using OrgTrac.

In order to install Android Studio simply go [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/install) and follow the directions to install the application.
