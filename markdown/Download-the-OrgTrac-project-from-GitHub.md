We will need to download the OrgTrac project from GitHub using your GitHub account. We'll do this using the GitHub.com and the GitHub Desktop application.

### Fork the OrgTrac Project
***

We will want our own version of the OrgTrac repository that we can download and update. The way to accomplish this is by creating what is called a _fork_ of the repository. This effectively gives us a full copy of the OrgTrac GitHub project that we own and can freely update without effecting the original OrgTrac GitHub project. We will do this because once we make changes to OrgTrac for our own organization we will want to be able to save those changes so we don't have to repeat them in the future.

Simply choose the _fork_ option at the upper right of any page while on the GitHub project, including at the top of this page. You may be prompted to select where to fork the project to if you have multiple GitHub accounts, if this occurs, be sure to choose the account we created.

### Launch GitHub Desktop and Download Repository
***

When you first open GitHub Desktop you will be presented with the **Welcome** screen. We will choose the _Sign into GitHub.com_ option and use the GitHub account we created.

Follow the prompts within the application until you are presented with the **Repositories** screen. Here we will choose the _Clone a Repository_ option.

Once you choose the _Clone a Repository_ option you will be able to choose the repository you forked into your account as seen in the **Clone a Repository** screen. Choose the _Local Path_ where you wish to download the project to and click _Clone_, this will download the entire project to the _Local Path_ you chose.
